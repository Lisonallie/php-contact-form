### PHP Contact Form

#### What it is
I was assigned a project to create a contact form using PHP. The contact form had no importance placed upon CSS and more upon functionality. It was important that the form worked and the learner discovered how to do it all.

#### How did I do it?
I first started by making the form in HTML using semantic HTML. I then connected my form identities with the `POST` method and included the `POST` action in variables in PHP.
